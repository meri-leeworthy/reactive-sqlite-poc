# Reactive SQLite poc

Testing a new frontend architecture for Roomy. Big ideas:

- Register Service Worker to receive push events
- Sync client in Service Worker receives a stream of events
- Service worker can queue incoming events in IDB if no tabs open
- Events are sent to Shared Worker running SQLite (wa-sqlite with OPFS VFS)
- Shared worker transforms each event into SQL transaction and applies
- Tabs running UI can subscribe to queries which are recomputed when data is updated
- Need to find way to optimise data recomputation for incremental updates - Timely/Differential Dataflow layer?

## Service Worker

It's worth noting that Sveltekit only bundles Service Workers in production, and in dev uses ES Modules. ES Modules in Service Workers, however, are not widely supported, which constrains us to using Chrome when using dev mode.

## Implementing WorkerManager

Yes, creating a `WorkerManager` abstraction makes perfect sense! This approach would provide a robust, environment-agnostic solution that gracefully degrades based on browser capabilities while maintaining a consistent API.

Here's a step-by-step plan to implement this:

## 1. **Create the WorkerManager Core Architecture**
- Design a `WorkerManager` class that acts as the main coordinator
- Implement environment detection to determine SharedWorker support
- Create a unified interface that abstracts away the worker type differences
- Add lifecycle management for worker initialization and cleanup

## 2. **Implement Service Worker Registration & Management**
- Create a `ServiceWorkerManager` class within the WorkerManager
- Handle Service Worker registration, updates, and lifecycle events
- Implement communication channels between the main thread and Service Worker
- Set up event listeners for sync client events and background tasks

## 3. **Build SharedWorker Implementation**
- Create a `SharedWorkerManager` for environments that support SharedWorkers
- Implement the SharedWorker script with wa-sqlite integration
- Set up message passing between main thread and SharedWorker
- Handle SharedWorker connection management and error recovery

## 4. **Create Dedicated Worker Fallback**
- Implement a `DedicatedWorkerManager` as the fallback option
- Ensure the same wa-sqlite module runs in the Dedicated Worker
- Maintain API compatibility with the SharedWorker implementation
- Handle worker spawning and message routing

## 5. **Design Unified Communication Protocol**
- Create a standardized message format that works across all worker types
- Implement request/response patterns for database operations
- Set up event broadcasting for real-time updates
- Handle connection state management and reconnection logic

## 6. **Implement Environment Detection & Auto-Selection**
- Detect browser capabilities (SharedWorker support, Service Worker support)
- Automatically select the best available worker strategy
- Provide manual override options for testing and debugging
- Log the selected strategy for debugging purposes

## 7. **Add Error Handling & Resilience**
- Implement graceful degradation when workers fail
- Add retry mechanisms for failed operations
- Handle worker crashes and automatic recovery
- Provide fallback to main-thread execution if all workers fail

## 8. **Create Configuration & Initialization System**
- Design a configuration object for worker settings
- Implement lazy initialization to defer worker creation until needed
- Add worker pooling for Dedicated Worker fallback scenarios
- Provide hooks for custom worker scripts and configurations

## 9. **Implement Testing & Debugging Tools**
- Create a debug mode that logs all worker communications
- Add worker health monitoring and status reporting
- Implement performance metrics for different worker strategies
- Provide tools to manually switch between worker types for testing

## 10. **Add Documentation & Examples**
- Document the WorkerManager API and configuration options
- Provide examples for different use cases and environments
- Create migration guides for existing wa-sqlite implementations
- Document the communication protocol and message formats

This approach gives you:
- **Environment flexibility**: Works everywhere with graceful degradation
- **Consistent API**: Same interface regardless of underlying worker type
- **Future-proofing**: Easy to add new worker strategies or update existing ones
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and unified error handling
- **Performance**: Optimal worker type selection based on browser capabilities

The key insight is that by abstracting the worker management, you can ensure your sync client and database operations work consistently across all environments while taking advantage of SharedWorker benefits when available.
